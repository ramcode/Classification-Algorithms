# ClassificationAlgorithms-DataMining Project3

Step to run Project Components

1. Extract project3.jar from Project.zip to any location on your system.
2. create data folder in same directory as project3.jar and add data files you want to run(ex project3_dataset1.txt, project3_dataset2.txt)
3. Give the following commands to run specific Classification algorithm
    1. For Running KNN
     java -cp project3.jar RunKNearestNeighbour
    2. For Running NaiveBayes
     java -cp project3.jar RunNaiveBayes
    3. For Running DecisionTree
     java -cp project3.jar RunDecisionTree
    4. For Running RandomForest
     java -cp project3.jar RunRandomForest
    5. For Running RandomForestWithBoosting
      java -cp project3.jar RunRandomForestBoosting
